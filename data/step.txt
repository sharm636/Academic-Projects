1. Structure (stone or wood) that provides a stable vertical rise on the trail, usually in sets.  Stepping Stone: Large rocks set in boggy areas or shallow stream crossings to provide passage for hikers. Step, Pinned: Step held in place on a ledge or a rock slab by steel pins set in holes drilled in the rock. 

2. Cribbed stairs (that use ¡®cribbing,¡¯a framework of wooden bars for support) are very stable and long lasting. They are more challenging to site and construct, fitting most easily into hillsides with consistent slope. This allows uniform riser and tread, improving safety. There are several styles and a variety of materials for use in stairs. In general, steps are avoided if a longer, sloped route is possible. However, sometimes a more vertical route is needed to minimize the impact of a
longer, sloped trail. Steps and stairs should not be used on outdoor access routes and accessible trails. They can be used at the beginning of a trail to signal
that trail is not accessible or is closed to bicycles and wheeled vehicles.

3. Timber steps are easier to build than cribbed steps. They may be more easily fitted into slopes that do not have a consistent slope. Although it is desirable to have consistent tread depths, timbers allow a consistent riser height and varying tread that can adjust to slope of the hillside. Since the timber steps lack the side-boards of the cribbed steps, fill will tend to fall to the side and may create tripping hazards. This can be minimized by adding native soil or larger rocks at the sides of the backfill. There are several styles and a variety of materials for stairs. In general, steps are avoided if a longer, sloped route is possible. Maintenance access with wheelbarrows is much easier on slopes than steps. However, sometimes a more vertical route is needed to minimize the impact of a longer, sloped trail or to discourage bicycles.
