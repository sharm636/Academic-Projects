1. A composition of coarse and fine aggregates, Portland cement, and water, blended to give a hard, unyielding, nearly white pavement, which can be finished to any degree of smoothness. Concrete is most often used in urban areas with anticipated heavy trail use, or in areas susceptible to flooding. 

2. Concrete is usually the longest lasting of the hard surface materials, but it is also one of the most expensive. Well-maintained concrete can last 25 years or more. The surface is appropriate for urban areas with severe climate swings and a susceptibility to flooding. However, the hard surface is taxing on runners¡¯ lower limbs, and is thus unpopular with that significant user group. Adjacent soft-surface treads can accommodate runners and equestrians where concrete is necessary for the main trail.

3. Concrete, the final common material utilized in multi-use trail design, has many advantages but is also not suited to every project.The main drawback to concrete is that, out of the three trail surface materials, it has the most expensive initial installation. Concrete also doesn¡¯t give like gravel does, so it can be harder on the joints of runners using the trail. Similar to asphalt, rainwater will not drain through the surface itself. However, note that water will drain through the 1/8¡¯¡¯ tread gaps in PermaTrak¡¯s boardwalk surface. Lastly, concrete doesn¡¯t have the ¡°softer¡± look that makes gravel an attractive aesthetic choice. 

The biggest advantage that concrete has over gravel and asphalt is its longevity (PermaTrak¡¯s precast concrete carries a design life of 50-75 years) and its minimal maintenance needs. Concrete as a material, whether it¡¯s precast or cast-in-place, stays consistent over time and through diverse weather conditions. While high scour could damage a concrete structure, the material is less susceptible to washing away and is easy to clean of debris after rain and storms.
