### Parks and Trails in Seattle

This is an exploratory data analysis(EDA) project for park trail features in Seattle, WA. Key analysis procedures include: data wrangling,
outlier detection and treament, Vector Space modeling application in surface type classification, PCA and clustering analysis as well as 
map visualizations. The project was originally completed in Rmarkdown (see the .html file output from Rmarkdown). I also replicated the key steps in python (see the .ipynb file) for learning and practice purpose.
